# A collection of most popular text browsers 

### I decided to collect all somewhat popular browsers that work in terminal and their sources. 
### Browsers included in this repo:
- [Netrik](https://netrik.sourceforge.net/), The ANTRIK Internet Viewer/Browser/Explorer/Navigator/whatever.
- [Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/), A text browser for the World Wide Web, [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser))
- [w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net), Text-based Web browser as well as pager, [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3m)
- [Links](http://www.elinks.cz/), A text WWW browser, similar to Lynx, [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(web_browser))
- [ELinks](http://www.elinks.cz/), Advanced, feature-rich text mode web browser, [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELinks)


I have found all browsers' sources, they will be located in `browsers-cources` folder. <br>
I don't think I will update sources, however I will place link to each browser's source.
