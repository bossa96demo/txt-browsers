This file presently only lists things that we consider quite important, and
which are not too hard to implement, without any major changes to the program
structure. These things may be implemented in some of the 1.x releases, but
some may also be moved to 2.x or some later point if the 2.0 branch starts
before they are implemented.

Versions 2.x and later are open for anything you can think of :-) (See
http://netrik.sf.net/dev.html for some ideas... Suggestions welcome :-) )

The parenthesis give information about the difficulty level of each task. If
you are interested in working on some of these, please subscribe to the mailing
list (see _Keeping in Touch_ in README), and tell us what you want to do.
